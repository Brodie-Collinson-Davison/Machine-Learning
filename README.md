The MNIST dataset is available at:http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

In order to run this program you will need to make sure the MNIST dataset files
are in the same directory as the executable, located in a folder named "MNIST_Dataset"
i.e when making a build, place a copy of the MNIST dataset in the directory of the executable

The folder contains a .pde file. This is for the program Processing
in order to run this you will need to download and install Processing from:https://processing.org/download

Ensure you have checked the Visualiser-Options.json file and confirm that the 'Network_Name' property has a correct value
